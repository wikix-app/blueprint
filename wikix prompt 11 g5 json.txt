
0) First :
 Use this tool to perform a single HTTP GET request to: https://wkx-techno-scrxr.vercel.app/api/get-images?topic=space%20weather&count=5&maxBytes=99997&allowTypes=jpg,jpeg,png
- if fetching fails : stop instructions and give me the closest wikipedia article name IN ENGLISH. Stop output.


1) Instruction

- if it works : Create a fun but full of knowledge fifteen-minutes course to know everything there is to know on that subject, using the information on wikipedia and the 5 images from the API response scattered relevantly throughout the course (in french).
- use full https links for images
- use the fetched captions from the tool under each image, translate them to french if needed. Synthetize them without losing info.
- it should be a full 15 minutes, not too short, exhaustive. 20 slides minimum.
- do not mention the 15 minutes length, nor sources.
- YOU WILL ONLY OUTPUT A .JSON FILE, NOT AN HTML ARTIFACT

2) Specific slides :

- 1st slide : The main title consists of only the topic name in french, with pronoun if relevant, NOTHING MORE, no other text or emojis.
- 2nd slide : "Introduction" : an introduction to the topic, explanation of the subject, with the main points that will be covered

Last three slides 
-1: "Conclusion" (NO EMOJI) : A fitting conclusion 
-2: "üìù Points essentiels" : A short summary of the most important points to remember.
-3: "üìö Pour aller plus loin" : Further readings : 5 possibilities of articles on similar subjects, to continue on. 


3) Content :
- Make it fun, but knowledge oriented. No exclamation points everywhere.
- Add relevant emojis to titles and lists
- Every info should be interesting.
- In a clear, engaging teaching tone ‚Äî like a great instructor speaking directly to curious learners. Active voice with varied rhythm. Include quick real-world examples or micro case studies to make concepts concrete. Liveliness from storytelling, clarity, and pacing.
- NOT TOO COMPLEX OR OBSCURE ! SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE.

8) 
- give me the result in .json
- stop output
