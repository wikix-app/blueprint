1)
- Find 2 new different visual you could add, that would improve this course. Exemple :

Table, List, Comparison Chart, Timeline, Flowchart, Graph, Data Visualization, Layered Diagram, Infographic-style, pie chart, bar chart, circular/radial, line graph, color-coded scale, vertical map with color bands, pyramid, network, spider chart


2)
- Create slides with these visuals (IN FRENCH)
- For each new slide, specify its position in the course using a decimal number (e.g. “Slide 3.5” goes between slides 3 and 4).
- wrap them in :  <!-- Slide X.5 -->
<div class="slide slideX.5" data-slide="X.5">

3)
- Every visual must be of a different type
- They should all be useful and relevant to their position in the course, and add an information that wasn't there yet.
- They should all be PRECISE and ACCURATE (no approximation)
- They should all use proper sentences structure
- No exclamation points

4) Size and Layout Constraints:
- MANDATORY : Each visual must be 1080×1920, for mobile use.
- Add a #EDFAF0 background BEHIND EVERY VISUAL
- Non-moving, non-interactive

5) Writings :
- Add a relevant title in #2E8B57
- Use google nunito everywhere
- Text 32px, tile 48px
- Each label must stay readable at 400×600 px.
- Outline or shadows for maximum readibility

6) VERY IMPORTANT :
- MAKE SURE THE VISUALS DO NOT OVERLAP
- MAKE SURE THE CONTAINERS DO NOT HIDE EACH OTHERS
- MAKE SURE THE THE #EDFAF0 background IS FULL AND UNINTERRUPTED FROM TOP OF THE DOC TO BOTTOM
- MAKE SURE TEXTS FIT IN THEIR CONTAINER
- ALL TEXT MUST BE VISIBLE, NONE MUST OVERLAP.

7) Theme :
- Use the same color theme as the slides for the course
- However, inside the visual, make it colorful, make it pop, make it vibrant !
- MAKE THEM VERY VERY VERY PRETTY ! shadow, outline, visual effects, relevant emojis !
- NO ASCII, NO SVG
- NO HOVER OR INTERACTIVE EFFECTS

- After sending the next HTML artifact : stop output
