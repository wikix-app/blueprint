
0) BEFORE WE START:

- YOU WILL ONLY DO 5 SLIDES AT A TIME, AND CONFIRM HERE WHEN YOU ARE READY FOR THE NEXT SLIDES
- YOU WILL NOT REWRITE ANY SLIDE EVER : ONCE WRITTEN, IT IS DONE.
- YOU WILL CONFIRM YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD STEP 2 AND WILL APPLY IT TO EVERY SLIDE BEFORE STARTING.

- Now read the instructions

1) Instructions:
- Fetch and use the full HTML + CSS from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikix-app/blueprint/refs/heads/main/tiny16.html
- This file is the **visual template**. 
- Fill the placeholders with the content from course .json

2) MANDATORY :

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT : 
- Use the .md doc to know which slide goes with which template slide, searching by data-slide="x" in the template
- Use the EXACT visual structure from template slide data-slide="x"  that you fetched - copy its internal divs, containers, and styling, then fill it with the content.

- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT : Do not change the slides order

3) Content :

- You MUST:
  - Keep the **progress bar** functional and visually identical, adjusted automatically to the new number of slides.
  - Keep all **console logs** and any JS already in the template unchanged.
  - Keep this local font src: url('../fonts/Nunito-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
  - Maintain all **fade transitions** 
  - Maintain slide navigation behavior, touch and swipe (last slide should loop back to first, and vice versa)
  - Replace "Point x" of the summary by the actual point, do not keep "point x"

4) Size :
- Each slide must contain ≤150 words
- If more text is needed, create additional slides using the template.

5) Rules (do not violate):
- No scrolling anywhere. Never use overflow, max-height + scroll, or custom CSS.
- Keep template classes/IDs and default sizes; do not change fonts/margins.
- Do not place anything under the progress bar area.
- Do NOT rewrite CSS, create new classes, or add new global styles.
- Every slide MUST START with <!-- Slide X: name of the slide --> above it
- Photo captions MUST BE CENTERED
