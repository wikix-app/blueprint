After every slide is done : rename each slide to be in order of their appearance in the new html:

<!-- Slide 1 -->
<div class="slide slide1" data-slide="1">

<!-- Slide 2 -->
<div class="slide slide2" data-slide="2">

...etc. DO NOT REWRITE ANYTHING ELSE, JUST THE SLIDES NUMBERS.
- give me the updated downloadable html

Most slides are missing 1/2 more bold green emphasized words, check the template
----------------------

slides 5 13 17 : 
- the slide is too long, divide into 2
- name them : 5.1 and 5.2 for example (in comment, and <div class="slide slidex" data-slide="x">
- if the slide contains 2 type of containers for the text, divide them by container
- if not, keep the 1st slide as it is, but create a new container style for the 2nd one, keeping the same color theme though
- give me the corrected slide snippets only

Vis 2 - How to prompt for compact timelines:
To get this compact spacing in future timelines, you can say:

"Create a compact timeline with minimal vertical spacing between events"
"Make a timeline where the date markers on the central axis are close together (about 150-200px apart)"
"Timeline with tight spacing - events should be vertically close but not overlapping"
"Create a timeline with fixed item height of 150-190px per event"

The key is specifying either the exact height per item or requesting "compact/tight vertical spacing" explicitly.

    <div style="height: 500px;"></div>
