
1) Instructions:
- The html file is the visual template. 
- Fill the placeholders with the content from the .json
- Change the file name to the course name.

2) MANDATORY :

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT : 
- Use the .md doc to know which slide goes with which template slide, searching by data-slide="x" in the template
- Use the EXACT visual structure from template slide data-slide="x"  that you fetched - copy its internal divs, containers, and styling, then fill it with the content.
- Do not change the slides order
- use the two linked .txt to implement the slide navigation system, and the exact html/CSS/js for photos (slide 19) and visuals (slide 19.1). DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THESE 3 ELEMENTS.

3) Content :

- You MUST:
  - Keep this local font src: url('../fonts/Nunito-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
  - Replace "Point x" of the summary by the actual point (do not keep "point x")

4) Size :
- Each slide must contain ≤150 words
- If more text is needed, create additional slides using the template.

5) Rules (do not violate):
- No scrolling anywhere. Never use overflow, max-height + scroll, or custom CSS.
- Keep template classes/IDs and default sizes; do not change fonts/margins.
- Do not place anything under the progress bar area.
- Do NOT rewrite CSS, create new classes, or add new global styles.
- Every slide MUST START with <!-- Slide X: name of the slide --> above it
- Photo captions MUST BE CENTERED
