Read this course, and you can use wikipedia article on the course topic as well.

1)
- Find at least 7-15 visuals you could add, that would improve this course. 

2)
- Create slides with these visuals (IN FRENCH) (only placeholders for now), and interpolate them inside the .json
- Do not put a visual next to an image, only next to text content.
- In the slide, just add a placeholder url indicating the type of visual (it will be the image of the visual later on)
- NO CAPTIONS, NO TITLES.
- Name exemple : VISUAL_14_PREDICTION_FLOW

3) 
- The visuals can also replace one slide if it's now redundant
- In doubt : keep the visual, not the slide

4)
- Every visual must be of a different type
- They should all be useful and relevant to their position in the course, and add an information that wasn't there yet.
- They should be scattered all around the course, not all in the first slides
- Every word in french except specific names, expressions or quotes that are more known in their original language. Put them inside "" if not french.

5) 
- make sure no image and visual are next to each others
- adjust the slide numbers for all document (all slides should follow a slide number, even visuals and images, so we know how many slides total)


6) 
- IMPORTANT : The visuals should contain A LOT OF information, not just a few words !

7) - At the end of each visual :
- Provide short, clear captions for any numbers, units, symbols, abbreviations, or terms that might be difficult to understand
- DO NOT ADD A TITLE to that part

8) Output :
A. the updated .json
B. a dedicated text document giving all content necessary to create the visuals (no layout or description, or slide numbers : only content). 
- Numerically sorted. Visual1, Visual2...
- Do not give write the slide number, or visual layout suggestions

C. a small paragraph text in conversation, explaining the slide number for each visual, and how many there are, and which ones have been removed
