

Constraints :

1) Basics :
- 4K OUTPUT MANDATORY
- 9:16 format ratio
- EVERY WORD IN FRENCH, except quotes
- DO NOT PUT ANY TITLE OR SUBTITLE, we should understand it by reading the visual
- Do not mention that the course is in french

2) Visually :
- MANDATORY EXACTLY #EDFAF0 background 
- For the rest : pretty modern colors, vibrant, beautiful, original
- Use MEDIUM-TO-HIGH saturation colors with good contrast against the background, not pale but not overwhelming
- Images in simple drawing, sketches, paint, pencil, felt-tip, colored (more than realism)
- If you can make it 3D, do it
- Rough, spontaneous, imperfect, but still made by a professional (not too childish)
- Important : With visible hand-drawn strokes every time.
- MAKE THE VISUAL FEEL FULL, NOT TOO MUCH EMPTY BACKGROUND SPACE

3) Containers :
- Pretty containers in theme with the topic, like drawings, with colored backgrounds
- ALWAYS light/white fonts 
- ALWAYS darker color containers

4) Text :
- Nunito font everywhere
- Crisp text, sharp, clear
- VERY BIG TEXT so it's easily readable, FILL THE BLANK SPACE with text and color
- Do not make the text all black and similar : break monotony
- Put any non-French word inside quotation marks.

5) Content :
- You can synthetize the content to make text bigger and more readable, without losing info NOR PROPER SENTENCE STRUCTURE
- Add sufficient information, it should not just be images, we need text and information

NO TITLE. NO TITLE. NO TITLE.

DO NOT ASK ME A QUESTION, START THE VISUAL RIGHT AWAY, NO QUESTION
