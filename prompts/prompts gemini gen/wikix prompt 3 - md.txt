- You HAVE TO:
  - REARRANGE THE SS TO FIT THE COURSE  
  - MAKE SURE YOU USE SS FROM EVERY PART OF THE TEMPLATE, NOT JUST THE FIRST HALF OF THE TEMPLATE
  - Make sure emphasis box SS are only used for the most important points/ key takeaways
  - Make sure images are alone (no title, one caption) 
  - Make sure quote box is ONLY USED TO PUT AN ATTRIBUTED QUOTE, OTHERWISE DO NOT USE IT
  - Make sure SS 23 (circle) is used with a small text, as it is a small slide 
  - Add 1-3 #2E8B57 bold to emphasis important words, or chunk of words, for slides that don't have enough. EXCEPT for emphasis box slides that have #2E8B57 background colors. For these slides, the bold emphasis words are #baf990

- You CANNOT :
  - USE THE SAME SS TWICE (unless it's a special slide)
  - PUT 2 SPECIAL SLIDES NEXT TO EACH OTHER. Each special slide should be surrounded by normal slides.
  - une another SS than 19 (images) for images
  - use another SS than 19.1 (visual) for visuals

2) QUOTE BOX RULES - READ CAREFULLY:
- Quote boxes can ONLY be used when the slide content contains:
  * An ACTUAL QUOTE with quotation marks from a real named person
- If the slide does NOT contain a direct quote with attribution, DO NOT USE quote box SS
   
3) BEFORE WE START:

3.1) IN A MARKDOWN ARTIFACT :
- You will send me the list of planned slides/SS before starting so i can validate them. 
Format : - Slide X - title (SS data-slide="Y") (Text/Image/Visual) *return to line*

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES - CHECK BEFORE SENDING:
- Emphasis box lines: wrap the ENTIRE line in **bold markdown** like **- Slide X - title (SS...) (Emphasis box)**
- Visuals lines: wrap the ENTIRE line in _underline markdown_ like _- Slide X - title (SS...) (Visual)_
- Image lines: wrap the ENTIRE line in *italic markdown* like *- Slide X - title (SS...) (Image)*
- Regular text: no formatting at all

BEFORE YOU SEND: Visually verify that emphasis boxes are bold, visuals are underlined, images are italic in the artifact.

3.2)In conversation (NOT IN THE ARTIFACT) :
- you will explain the rason for choosing these SS :
* emphasis box (why is it important ?)
* quote box (ONLY FOR QUOTES) 
* images : (only SS 19)
* visuals : (only SS 19.1)

- You will tell me how many SS you have used for each half of the template : both numbers should be the same. ONLY THE NUMBER.
- you will tell me if other images/visuals could have been useful to add to this artifact ? or not.
