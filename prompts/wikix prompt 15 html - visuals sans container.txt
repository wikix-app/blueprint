Add another relevant visual, in a new position in the course, in a completely new visual type that has not been used yet. 48px title, 32px font, 1080×1920, 
#EDFAF0 background, same color theme, PRETTY COLORS INSIDE
For each new slide, specify its position in the course using a decimal number (e.g. “Slide 3.5” goes between slides 3 and 4).
wrap them in : <!-- Slide X.5 --> <div class="slide slideX.5" data-slide="X.5">
YOU ADD THE VISUAL AT THE END OF THE ALREADY 5 VISUALS IN THE HTML ARTIFACT WE ARE CUSTOMIZING. NOT IN THE COURSE

DO NOT REWRITE WHAT IS ALREADY WRITTEN

----------
Suggest 10 new visuals and their position in the course, with 10 completely new visual types. Don't code, just list them.

0) Fetch this course : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikix-app/blueprint/refs/heads/main/courseeuropa.html

Read this course, and you can use wikipedia article on the course topic as well.

1)
- Find 3 new different non-moving, non-interactive visuals you could add, that would improve this course. Exemple :

Table, List, Comparison Chart, Timeline, Flowchart, Graph, Data Visualization, Layered Diagram, Infographic-style, pie chart, bar chart, circular/radial, line graph, color-coded scale, vertical map with color bands, pyramid, network, spider chart


2)
- Create slides with these visuals (IN FRENCH)
- For each new slide, specify its position in the course using a decimal number (e.g. “Slide 3.5” goes between slides 3 and 4).
- wrap them in :  <!-- Slide X.5 -->
<div class="slide slideX.5" data-slide="X.5">

3)
- Every visual must be of a different type
- They should all be useful and relevant to their position in the course, and add an information that wasn't there yet.
- They should all be PRECISE and ACCURATE (no approximation)

4) Size and Layout Constraints:
- MANDATORY : Each visual must be 1080×1920, for mobile use.
- Add a #EDFAF0 background BEHIND EVERY VISUAL
- No overflow hidden - I need to see everything. Add scrolling or flexible height so nothing is cut off


5) Writings :
- Add a relevant title in #2E8B57
- Use google nunito everywhere
- Text 32px, tile 48px
- Each label must stay readable at 400×600 px.
- Make sure no texts ever overlap

6) Theme :
- Use the same color theme as the slides for the course
- However, inside the visual, make it colorful, make it pop, make it vibrant !
- MAKE THEM VERY VERY VERY PRETTY ! shadow, outline, visual effects, relevant emojis !
- NO ASCII, NO SVG
- NO HOVER OR INTERACTIVE EFFECTS

- After sending the next HTML artifact : stop output.

=============










“A mobile-friendly diagram at 1080×1920 px, with large readable labels and minimal text.”
 Use large, readable text suitable for a phone screen.”
“Design for mobile readability — imagine each label must stay readable at 400×600 px.”

- visuals ask green
- fhd
- utiliser le customize
- titres no emoji

--------------------------
“Limit labels to a a few words per box.
“A mobile-friendly diagram at 600×1000 px, with large readable labels and minimal text.”
==============================







6)
- If a visual would exceed these limits, summarize it without losing information or proper structure.
- If it's already summarized : split it into multiple slides instead of resizing beyond them.

7) MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL : THE VISUAL CANNOT EVER BE BIGGER THAN ITS CONTAINER. IF THE VISUAL IS BIGGER THAN THE CONTAINER, YOU HAVE 100% FAILED THIS TASK.







use this local font src: url('../fonts/Nunito-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype') 
- MANDATORY : ALL THE FONTS HAVE TO BE 16PX. TITLE 24PX.


, width : 100%.
- They should fill the box to the max without overflowing
- Use coordinates or dimensions that stay inside this box 
- YOU MUST wrap every visual in:
 <div class="slide slideX.5" data-slide="X.5">
  <div class="content">
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Visual title</h2>
    <div style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: 600px; border: 3px solid #3CB371; border-radius: 8px; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #e8f5e9 0%, #f0fdf4 100%); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-size: clamp(18px, 4vw, 24px); color: #2E8B57; font-weight: 600; margin: 10px 0 20px 0; overflow: hidden;">
