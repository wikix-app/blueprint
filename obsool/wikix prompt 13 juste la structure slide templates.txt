For this request : 
- SS are the name of the template slides from the template.
- Slides are the name of the slides from the .json

0) Instructions:
- Fetch and use the full HTML + CSS from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikix-app/blueprint/refs/heads/main/tiny3.html
- This file is the **visual template**. 
- You must COPY ITS STYLE AND STRUCTURE EXACTLY :same fonts, colors, containers, transitions, spacing, and layout logic.
- Fill only the placeholder text with the course .json I have provided

1) Content

- You MUST:
  - Keep these slides in their position : 1 (title), 2 (introduction), and the last 3 (conclusion, summary, further readings), using the corresponding SS

- You HAVE TO:
  - REARRANGE THE SS TO FIT THE COURSE  
  - MAKE SURE YOU USE SS FROM EVERY PART OF THE TEMPLATE, NOT JUST THE FIRST HALF OF THE TEMPLATE
  - Make sure emphasis box SS are only used for the most important points/ key takeaways
  - Make sure images are alone (with title and caption) 
  - Make sure quote box is ONLY USED TO PUT AN ATTRIBUTED QUOTE, OTHERWISE DO NOT USE IT

- You CANNOT :
  - USE THE SAME SS TWICE 
  - put 2 similar SS (emphasis box, or photo, or quote) next to each other 
  - une another SS than 19 (photo) for images
  - use a box quote when the slide does not contain a quote

2) QUOTE BOX RULES - READ CAREFULLY:
- Quote boxes can ONLY be used when the slide content contains:
  * An ACTUAL QUOTE with quotation marks from a named person
  * Example: "The sun is amazing" - Dr. Jane Smith
- If the slide does NOT contain a direct quote with attribution, DO NOT USE quote box SS

3) BEFORE WE START:

3.1)IN A MARKDOWN ARTIFACT :
- You will send me the list of planned slides/SS before starting so i can validate them. 
Format : - Slide X - title (SS data-slide="Y") (Text/Photo) *return to line*

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES - CHECK BEFORE SENDING:
- Emphasis box lines: wrap the ENTIRE line in **bold markdown** like **- Slide X - title (SS...) (Emphasis box)**
- Quote box lines: wrap the ENTIRE line in _underline markdown_ like _- Slide X - title (SS...) (Quote box)_
- Photo lines: wrap the ENTIRE line in *italic markdown* like *- Slide X - title (SS...) (Photo)*
- Regular text: no formatting at all

BEFORE YOU SEND: Visually verify that emphasis boxes are bold, quotes are underlined, photos are italic in the artifact.

3.2)In conversation (NOT IN THE ARTIFACT) :
- you will explain the rason for choosing these SS :
* emphasis box (why is it important ?)
* quote box (ONLY FOR QUOTES) 
* photo : (only SS 19)

- You will tell me how many SS you have used for each half of the template : both numbers should be the same. ONLY THE NUMBER.

4)
- After sending the completed list (in a markdown artifact) : stop output and await validation.
