Read this course, and you can use wikipedia article on the course topic as well.

1)
- Find 5 different non-interactive visuals you could add, that would improve this course. Exemple :

Table, List, Comparison Chart, Timeline, Flowchart, Graph, Data Visualization, Layered Diagram, Infographic-style, pie chart, bar chart, circular/radial, line graph, color-coded scale, vertical map with color bands

Do not use any of the visuals in visuals1.html

2)
- Create new slides with these visuals IN A NEW HTML ARTIFACT DOCUMENT
- DO NOT ADD THEM TO THE EXISTING ARTIFACT, CREATE A NEW ARTIFACT WITH ONLY THE NEW VISUAL SLIDES.

3)
- For each new slide, specify its position using a decimal number (e.g. “Slide 3.5” goes between slides 3 and 4).
- Every visual must be of a different type
- They should all be useful and relevant to their position in the course, and add an information that wasn't there yet.
- They should all be PRECISE and ACCURATE (no approximation)
- MAKE THEM VERY PRETTY, WITH COLORS
- NO ASCII, NO SVG

4) 
- use this local font src: url('../fonts/Nunito-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype') 
- MANDATORY : ALL THE FONTS HAVE TO BE 16PX. TITLE 24PX.

5) Size and Layout Constraints:

- MANDATORY : Each visual must fit entirely within a 600×600px box, width : 100%.
- They should fill the box to the max without overflowing
- Use coordinates or dimensions that stay inside this box 
- YOU MUST wrap every visual in:
 <div class="slide slideX.5" data-slide="X.5">
  <div class="content">
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Visual title</h2>
    <div style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: 600px; border: 3px solid #3CB371; border-radius: 8px; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #e8f5e9 0%, #f0fdf4 100%); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-size: clamp(18px, 4vw, 24px); color: #2E8B57; font-weight: 600; margin: 10px 0 20px 0; overflow: hidden;">
      Visual
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

6)
- If a visual would exceed these limits, summarize it without losing information or proper structure.
- If it's already summarized : split it into multiple slides instead of resizing beyond them.

7) MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL : THE VISUAL CANNOT EVER BE BIGGER THAN ITS CONTAINER. IF THE VISUAL IS BIGGER THAN THE CONTAINER, YOU HAVE 100% FAILED THIS TASK.


- After sending the next HTML artifact : stop output.
