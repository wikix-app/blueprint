0) BEFORE WE START:

- YOU WILL ONLY DO 5 SLIDES AT A TIME, AND CONFIRM HERE WHEN YOU ARE READY FOR THE NEXT SLIDES
- YOU WILL NOT REWRITE ANY SLIDE EVER : ONCE WRITTEN, IT IS DONE
- You will send me the list of planned slides before starting so i can validate them. 
Format : - Slide X - title (template slide Y) *return to line*
- Now read the instructions

1) Instructions:
- Fetch and use the full HTML + CSS from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikix-app/blueprint/refs/heads/main/tiny3.html
- This file is the **visual template**. 
- You must COPY ITS STYLE AND STRUCTURE EXACTLY :same fonts, colors, containers, transitions, spacing, and layout logic.
- Fill only the placeholders with the course .json I have provided

2) Content :

- You MUST:
  - Keep these slides in their position : 1 (title), 2 (introduction), and the last 3 (conclusion, summary, further readings)
  - Keep the **progress bar** functional and visually identical, adjusted automatically to the new number of slides.
  - Keep all **console logs** and any JS already in the template unchanged.
  - Keep this local font src: url('../fonts/Nunito-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
  - Maintain all **fade transitions** and slide navigation behavior.

- You HAVE TO:
  - REARRANGE THE SLIDES TO FIT THE COURSE  
  - MAKE SURE YOU USE SLIDES FROM EVERY PART OF THE TEMPLATE, NOT JUST THE FIRST ONES
  - Make sure emphasis box slides are only used for the most important points/ key takeaways

- You CAN:
  - Rearrange existing container types.
  - Duplicate, merge, or remove slides if it makes the pacing better.
  - Adapt each slide’s type to match the new course flow.

- You CANNOT :
  - USE THE SAME SLIDE TWICE 
  - put 2 similar slides (emphasis box, or photo) next to each other 
  - une another slide than 19 (photo) for images

4) Size :
- Each slide must contain ≤150 words
- If more text is needed, create additional slides.
- Prefer short, concise sentences and bullet lists, while keeping proper sentences structure.
- Never fill slides to the max; leave ~10% empty space.

5) Rules (do not violate):
- No scrolling anywhere. Never use overflow, max-height + scroll, or custom CSS.
- Keep template classes/IDs and default sizes; do not change fonts/margins.
- 1 heading ≤ 60 chars; 3–6 bullets, each ≤ 12 words; no deep nesting.
- ≤ 1 main visual per slide; large tables split across slides (≤ 6 rows, ≤ 3 cols).
- Do not place anything under the progress bar area.
- Do NOT rewrite CSS, create new classes, or add new global styles.
- Images should be alone (with title and caption) on their slides
- Every slide MUST START with <!-- Slide X: name of the slide --> above it

- After sending the completed html artifact : stop output.











===========
  - RANDOMIZE THE OTHER SLIDES FROM TH so it's a completely new order. The seed id 675867


- Adjust font size automatically to keep the content readable and fully visible.

6) In the template, these specific slides apparences are only used once, nowhere else :
1 : for main title, 2 : for introduction, 52 : for conclusion, 53 : for summary, 54 : for further readings
